# Levenshtein-Distance-Finder
The Levenshtein distance is a string metric that measures the difference between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.
Levenshtein distances have been used for decades in applications ranging from spelling correction and web search suggestions to DNA analysis.
